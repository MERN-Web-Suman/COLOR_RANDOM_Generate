# welcome to Color random generate

This project demonstrates how to create a random color generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a user-friendly interface with a button labeled "Generate Color." When the button is clicked, JavaScript generates a random hexadecimal color code and updates the background color of the webpage accordingly. The corresponding hex code is also displayed on the screen, allowing users to see the exact color value. The layout is styled with basic CSS for a clean and modern appearance. This project is ideal for beginners learning how to integrate interactivity and dynamic content using simple front-end web development techniques.
